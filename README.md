Stackato?
---------

See: http://www.activestate.com/stackato

Pronounced like the musical term, "staccato", a cloudish, PaaS type thing. But
it's very useful and getting cooler every day.

When you deploy it in a large scale or for commercial use, it does cost money.
However, there is a version that is and will always be free for
single-instance non-commercial use: The Microcloud version:

(Note that the above script is simply a convenience tool, and everything can
be done manually if you need.)

There is more to say, but for now this is a placeholder for our tools.


Pair Programming
----------------

Stackato is particularly interesting in its role as a pair programming
rendezvous point.
